## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for Module 3 — AI Robot Brain with 40+ tasks organized by user story priority. Tasks are structured in phases: Setup, Foundational, and three user stories (Platform Foundations, Perception & Manipulation, RL & Sim-to-Real) followed by polish phase. Each task follows the required checklist format with ID, story labels, and specific file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created with 40+ specific implementation tasks organized by priority
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks organized by user story enabling independent implementation and testing
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with structured phases and dependencies
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation following the task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks successfully organized by user story to enable independent development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - tasks created successfully according to template
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all tasks follow required checklist format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks
