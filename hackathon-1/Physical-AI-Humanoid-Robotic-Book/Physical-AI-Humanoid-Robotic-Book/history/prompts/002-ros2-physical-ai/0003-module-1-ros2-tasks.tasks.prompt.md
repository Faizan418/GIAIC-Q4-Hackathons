## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Module 1 — ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System. The tasks.md file includes:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for ROS 2 curriculum directory structure and image directories
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for basic document creation and metadata setup
- Phase 3: Chapter 1 implementation (P1 - Understanding Physical AI and ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Phase 4: Chapter 2 implementation (P2 - Embodied Intelligence and Sensors)
- Phase 5: Chapter 3 implementation (P3 - ROS 2 Architecture)
- Phase 6: Chapter 4 implementation (P4 - Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions)
- Phase 7: Chapter 5 implementation (P5 - ROS 2 Packages and Launch Files)
- Phase 8: Polish and cross-cutting concerns for final refinement

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, chapter labels, and file paths. The tasks are organized by chapter to enable independent implementation and testing, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

The implementation follows the curriculum progression from foundational Physical AI concepts through advanced system composition, with each chapter containing 5000-7000 words of substantive educational content. Each chapter includes required code examples, diagrams, and hands-on labs as specified in the original requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created for ROS 2 curriculum module with 55+ specific implementation tasks
- 🧪 Tests: No explicit tests required for documentation feature, validation through review process
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive task breakdown following template structure
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to begin implementation following task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown enables incremental delivery starting with MVP (Chapter 1)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 and 2 tasks
