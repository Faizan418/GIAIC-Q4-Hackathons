type: sp.plan
title: Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Execution Plan
target_platform: Docusaurus v3
status: ready-for-production
---

## Plan Objective

Execute **Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** as a cohesive production unit that enables humanoid robots to **perceive, reason, and act** using tightly integrated motion control, manipulation, and language-driven cognition.

This plan directly operationalizes the corresponding **/sp.specify** without phased segmentation.

---

## Scope of Work

This plan covers the complete production of the following chapters:

- `11-Humanoid-Kinematics-and-Locomotion.md`
- `12-Manipulation-and-Human-Robot-Interaction.md`
- `13-Conversational-Robotics.md`

---

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created the implementation plan for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robots. The plan includes:

1. **Technical Context**: Architecture overview of vision, language, and action systems
2. **Constitution Check**: Verification of alignment with project principles
3. **Phase 0 Research**: Comprehensive research on humanoid kinematics, manipulation, conversational robotics, and VLA integration patterns
4. **Phase 1 Design**: Data models and API contracts for the VLA system
5. **Phase 2 Implementation Roadmap**: Detailed roadmap for the three documentation chapters
6. **Risk Analysis**: Identification and mitigation strategies for computational, safety, and performance risks
7. **Validation Strategy**: Comprehensive testing approach for simulation, integration, and real-world validation

Additionally, created all required documentation files:
- 11-Humanoid-Kinematics-and-Locomotion.md: Comprehensive guide to humanoid kinematics and locomotion
- 12-Manipulation-and-Human-Robot-Interaction.md: Guide to dexterous manipulation and interaction protocols
- 13-Conversational-Robotics.md: Guide to natural language processing and dialogue management

All files follow Docusaurus v3 standards with proper frontmatter and are ready for production use.

## OUTCOME

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module planning is complete with all required documentation created. The implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for developing humanoid robots capable of perceiving the world, reasoning using language, and executing physical actions. The three core documentation chapters cover all essential aspects of VLA systems: kinematics and locomotion, manipulation and interaction, and conversational robotics.
