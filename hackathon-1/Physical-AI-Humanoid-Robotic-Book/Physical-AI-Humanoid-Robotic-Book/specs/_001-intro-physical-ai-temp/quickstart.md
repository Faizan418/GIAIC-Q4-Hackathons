# Quickstart: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Overview
This quickstart guide helps you understand and create the introductory chapter for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of the project constitution and requirements
- Access to research materials on Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Docusaurus documentation system set up

## Steps to Create the Introduction

### 1. Content Creation
1. Start with the core definition of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence
2. Build the narrative from basic concepts to more complex ideas
3. Include the required diagrams: "Digital AI → Physical AI pipeline" and "Sense → Think → Act loop"
4. Ensure content is between 1,500-1,700 words
5. Write in Docusaurus-compatible Markdown format

### 2. Quality Assurance
1. Verify all claims are research-backed
2. Check that content aligns with academic standards (APA citations)
3. Ensure diagrams enhance understanding of abstract concepts
4. Confirm the content is accessible to students with varying technical backgrounds
5. Validate that the word count is within the required range

### 3. Integration
1. Place the completed chapter as `docs/01-Introduction.md`
2. Add diagrams to `static/img/` directory
3. Verify the content follows Docusaurus structure and styling
4. Test the rendered documentation locally

## Key Success Metrics
- Students can articulate the difference between Physical AI and traditional digital AI
- 90% of students can identify reasons why humanoid robots are important
- Content is well-received and aligns with technical rigor expectations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Including heavy code examples (contrary to requirements)
- Failing to explain the simulation-first learning philosophy
- Not adequately contrasting digital vs physical AI
- Missing the required diagrams
- Exceeding or falling short of word count requirements
