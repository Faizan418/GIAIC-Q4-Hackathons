## Simulation to Perception Pipeline

This diagram shows the complete pipeline from Isaac Sim generating synthetic sensor data to Isaac ROS processing that data through GPU-accelerated perception nodes. The pipeline demonstrates how simulation data flows through the system to produce perception results that can be used for decision making, with connections to real-world sensors and robots.
