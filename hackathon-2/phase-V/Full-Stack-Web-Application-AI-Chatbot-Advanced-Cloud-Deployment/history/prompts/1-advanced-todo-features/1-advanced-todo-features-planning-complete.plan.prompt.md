response_text: |
  Successfully completed the planning phase for advanced todo features by creating:
  1. Implementation plan (plan.md) - detailing all phases and tasks
  2. Research findings (research.md) - addressing all unknowns and clarifications
  3. Data model extensions (data-model.md) - defining new fields and relationships
  4. API contracts (todo-cohere-api.md) - specifying endpoints for Cohere integration
  5. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) - providing implementation instructions
  6. Summary document (SUMMARY.md) - consolidating all planning work

  All research tasks and clarifications have been resolved, and the project is ready to move to the implementation phase. The plan follows the AGENTS.md constitution for Phase V, emphasizing Dapr abstractions, event-driven architecture, and cloud-native deployment patterns with Cohere API integration.
outcome: "Planning phase completed successfully with all required documentation created. Ready to move to implementation phase."
evaluation: "Successfully addressed all requirements in the prompt, created comprehensive planning documentation, and prepared the project for implementation."
