   - Message bubbles with proper styling
   - Typing indicators
   - Integration with MCP tools

### Backend Features
1. **API Endpoints**
   - Authentication (login, signup, refresh, logout)
   - Task management (CRUD operations)
   - Dashboard statistics
   - AI chat with MCP integration

2. **Security**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - User isolation (users can only access their own data)
   - Proper validation and error handling

3. **Database Integration**
   - Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
   - Proper connection pooling
   - Efficient queries

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Implemented
